# Python-Nats-Client

This is a simple python app I made to understand a little bit of how concurrency works with asyncio. 

Holds a very simple nats subscriber that can listen on a single topic from any other service.

Use crl+c to gracefully stop the app, terminate nats connection and flush requests.
